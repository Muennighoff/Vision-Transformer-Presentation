Presentation on Visual Transformer conducted at Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology on 21 April. 2021.

We discuss findings presented in [An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929) by Dosovitskiy, et al. and some earlier works. We introduce the concept of Vision Transformer, evaluate its advantages and disadvantages and make a few predictions on the future of the domain.
